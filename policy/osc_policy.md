# Open Source Policy

After the [organization](../organization/ospo.md) has been configured, the next step is to establish a policy.

Open source policy is necessary to protect intellectual property and mitigate compliance risk when organizations that distribute software use or contribute to open source. 
For efficient open source compliance activities, each company needs to establish the policy that matches the software type and business type.

The following discloses how LG Electronics has established an open source policy.

## LG Electronics Open Source Policy

LG Electronics open source policy applies when the software developed by LGE is distributed as open source or contributed to open source communities.
All LGE divisions and R&D labs that distribute the software must comply with these policies.
